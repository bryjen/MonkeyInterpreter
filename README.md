## Why F#?
While Thorsten Ball's  of the  [original implementation](https://interpreterbook.com/) of the interpreter is in Go, I find F# a much more interesting language to build programs in. 

I also believe that it is a great learning experience, for me, translating procedural Go code into idiomatically (or as idiomatic as possible) functional F# code.
